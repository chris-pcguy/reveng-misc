Asus "The new PadFone Infinity" A86 (T004) Unlock Instructions:

Pull the "aboot"-partition by either rooting the device or by getting it into the MSM-Mode (/dev/sd?5) e.g. by fastboot boot'ing a corrupt kernel.
Be sure to make a backup of it.
Open it in a hex editor and go to offset 0x4ffe00 (signature "ANDROID-BOOT!", the last occurrence of the string)
Set unlocked and authorized to 0x1, and tampered to 0x0.
Write it back. (especially for writing, use dd's flag bs=2048 !)
Have fun!

All values are DWORD's little-endian.

base=0x4ffe00
base+0x10 == unlocked
base+0x14 == tampered
base+0x18 == Charger screen enabled
base+0x5c == authorized
base+0x60 == cpu pvs
base+0x64 == cpu overclocking
base+0x68 == boot count

Enabling/Disabling SELinux enforcing (at least for the recovery image)
Kernel CMDLINE append: "UNLOCKED=Y" (this also enables "adb root")
echo 0 > /sys/fs/selinux/enforce
echo asussetenforce:0 > /proc/rd

What is this for and why is it only in user-builds?

what is SEL_APS in SELinux?
