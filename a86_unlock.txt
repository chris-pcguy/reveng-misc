Asus "The new PadFone Infinity" A86 (T004) Unlock Instructions:

Pull the "aboot"-partition by either rooting the device or by getting it into the MSM-Mode (/dev/sd?5) e.g. by fastboot boot'ing a corrupt kernel.
Be sure to make a backup of it.
Open it in a hex editor and go to offset 0x4ffe00 (signature "ANDROID-BOOT!", the last occurrence of the string)
Set unlocked and authorized to 0x1, and tampered to 0x0.
Write it back. (especially for writing, use dd's flags bs=2048 oflag=sync !)
Have fun!

All values are DWORD's little-endian.

base=0x4ffe00
base+0x10 == unlocked
base+0x14 == tampered
base+0x18 == Charger screen enabled
base+0x5c == authorized
base+0x60 == cpu pvs
base+0x64 == cpu overclocking
base+0x68 == boot count

Enabling/Disabling SELinux enforcing (at least for the recovery image)
Kernel CMDLINE append: "UNLOCKED=Y" (this also enables "adb root")
echo 0 > /sys/fs/selinux/enforce
echo asussetenforce:0 > /proc/rd

            memcpy(exif->info_3a, info_3a_data, 24);

What is this for and why is it only in user-builds?

what is SEL_APS in SELinux?

Recovering A86 from "QHSUSB__BULK (9008)":
Put a full dump on a MicroSD card and insert it. This should let it switch to MSM-Mode.
In MSM-Mode: (/dev/sd?*)
If you want to make it run without the MicroSD card: Put everything to the internal eMMC storage.
If not (only works with inserted MicroSD card): Put the first 2 Megabytes (or so) to the internal eMMC storage. 'fastboot boot' may reboot immediately if the battery is disconnected, but 'fastboot flash' seems to work.

P.S.:
You may have to disconnect the battery if you see "device descriptor read/64, error"-like messages.

Is there a way to recover the phone without soldering if aboot is flawed?
